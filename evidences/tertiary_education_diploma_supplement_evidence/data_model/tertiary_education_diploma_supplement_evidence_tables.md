This attribute also carries prefixes or suffixes which are part of the family name, e.g. ‚Äúde Boer‚Äù, ‚Äúvan de Putte‚Äù, ‚Äúvon und zu Orlow‚Äù. Multiple family names, such as are commonly found in Hispanic countries, are recorded in the single family name field so that, for example, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's family name would be recorded as "de Cervantes Saavedra".        |     [1..*]        | N/A       |
