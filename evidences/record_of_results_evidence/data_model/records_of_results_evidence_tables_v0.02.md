|     identifier          |     Identifier     |     Many organisations are referred to by an acronym or some other identifier. For example, among the EU institutions, the ECB is the identifier for the European Central Bank, OLAF for the European Anti-Fraud Office, and so on.

Primary names may be provided in multiple languages with multiple instances of the preferred label property.                                                                            |    [1..*]          |  N/A      |
