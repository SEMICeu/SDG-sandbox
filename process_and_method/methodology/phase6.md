## ` Step 24`  Review the final data model 

**Key activities**

  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  Working Group members discuss and validate the model with the business and functional experts and share their questions and / or remarks with the editors via the adequate channel. 
  
  In parallel, the editors collect and categorized the feedback. For instance,
  
  * Editorial changes
  * Minor semantic changes
  * Major semantic changes - this entails a new version of the data model to be drafted and proposed for review. 
  
  Ultimately, the Working Group members have to come to a [semantic agreement](terminology/README.md#semantic-agreement) with regards to the data models reviewed.

<b>Aspects</b> to bear in mind while reviewing:
  

* Data elements and entity names

<b>Questions</b> to bear in mind while reviewing: 

* Do I agree with the proposed controlled vocabularies?
* Do I agree with the proposed changes to the data models? 
* Are the entities and attributes definitions clear enough? 
* Does the modelling approach make sense? 
* Do I agree with the proposed cardinalities (i.e. mandatory versus optional)
* With data minimisation in mind, should some of the entities and or attributes stripped off?
* Will my country be able to provide all the mandatory information?
