# Methodology

This folder contains the various steps that together make up the methodology used to develop the data models of the evidences.

## Disclaimer

This process has been designed based on the work of modelling ten evidences qualified as relevant in the Study on Data Mapping for the cross-border application of the Once-Only technical system SDG. The process is general enough to be used for future procedures, that is, in addition to the ones identified by the SDGR. More importantly, as this process has been designed based on a sample of ten evidences, it should not be considered complete nor exhaustive. 

Essentially, this is a living document which is set to evolve as more evidences are being modelled and feedback fed in. 

Naturally, as the focus is on modeling evidences, aspects dealing with maintenance are not covered in this document.  

## Process

In order to tackle the problem of identifying common semantics for different types of evidence exchanged in cross-border administrative procedures, a specific process has been envisaged. The process consists of key phases as shown below. 
![Key phases](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/blob/master/process_and_method/methodology/img/methodology_phases.PNG)

There are six phases, which range from the identification of existing efforts, evidences and data models  to the creation of distributions and the publication of documentation and focus essentially on agreeing on semantics. True to the European Commissionâ€™ spirit, this methodology provides tools and guidelines on how to reach the wider consensus possible.

This process forms part of a broader context. It is therefore not the start point nor the end point of the initiative to develop common data models. It is clearly important to be conversant with what triggers the creation of a common data model and in what context this data model is going to be used. 

It is also worth outlining that such methodology only applies on the basis of preliminary work carried out upstream, i.e. the identification of the evidence to be modelled through the definition of use cases. Use cases determine for what purpose you need specific evidence in the context of a specific procedure and need to be defined and assessed to arrive at a relevant list of candidate evidences.  

The evidence selection process will imperatively require to fulfill certain criteria in order to be potentially retained. These different selection criteria pave the way for discussions aiming at defining which evidence is to be modelled. 

The involvement of domain experts (preferably from each member state) in this kind of discussion plays a key role in the collaboration between member states. Their knowledge of the different specific features of national use cases and evidence enables them to discuss and select the most relevant evidence to be modelled. 

Only once the list of evidence to be modelled is decided, the methodology can be applied.

**Access each phase**
- [`Phase 1`: Identify and analyse existing standardization efforts, evidences and data models](phase1.md)
- [`Phase 2`: Draft data model](phase2.md)
- [`Phase 3`: Select controlled vocabularies](phase3.md)
- [`Phase 4`: Review data model and incorporate comments](phase4.md)
- [`Phase 5`: Finalise data model](phase5.md)
- [`Phase 6`: Create distributions and publish documentation](phase6.md)

For each step, the key activities of every stakeholder group is described. If you would like to know the more general roles and responsibilities of a stakeholder group, please have a look at the section defining roles and responsibilities. In a similar manner, key terms are defined in the glossary.
Next to the key activities, when relevant, additional information is provided in the form of rules and guidelines, tools or even examples. This is intended to make this methodology as actionable as it can be, giving the reader the means to develop common data models. 
Finally, for each step, three types of activities have been identified. 
1. Business analysis, i.e. identifying business needs and determining solutions.
2. Technical analysis, i.e. identifying technical requirements and determining solutions.  
3. Review, i.e. formal assessment potentially leading to changes.

Business analysis activities are more present in the beginning of the methodology and as moving forward through the methodology they make room for technical activities. Just like any project, business needs are defined before technical needs. Review activities are scattered through the methodology. 

Tool-wise, GitHub was the preferred tool for reviewing the data models. GitHub is a collaborative tool with built-in versioning control as well as other features that make it easy to propose suggestions and raise issues. ([Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) you can find the documentation on how to create issues on GitHub.) 

It should also be considered that engagement is a key element to the process. Having a high participation and a lot of input leads to better output and a greater consensus. Working Group members, i.e. Member States representatives, should be well represented during activities along the way. 

Consensus is the driving force, therefore, ideally, as many Member States as possible should be involved in any of the activities.
