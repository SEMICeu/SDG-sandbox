# Methodology

This folder contains the various steps of a methodology to develop new data models for evidence types under the SDGR.
  
## Process

In order to model the semantics for different types of evidence exchanged in cross-border administrative procedures, the methodology envisions the following key phases as shown below: 
![Key phases](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/blob/master/process_and_method/methodology/img/methodology_phases.PNG)

There are six phases, which range from the identification of existing efforts, evidences and data models to the creation of distributions and the publication of documentation. 
This process should be placed in a broader context, in the sense that preliminary work carried out upstream, i.e. the identification of the evidence types to be modelled through the definition of use cases, is expected to take place. Use cases should determine for what purpose specific evidence types are needed in the context of a specific procedure.

The involvement of domain experts (preferably from each member state) in this kind of discussion plays a key role in the collaboration between member states. Their knowledge of the different specific features of national use cases and evidence enables them to discuss and select the most relevant evidence types to be modelled. 

Once the evidence type to be modelled is decided, the methodology can be applied.

**Access each phase**
- [`Phase 1`: Identify and analyse existing standardization efforts, evidences and data models](phase1.md)
- [`Phase 2`: Draft data model](phase2.md)
- [`Phase 3`: Select controlled vocabularies](phase3.md)
- [`Phase 4`: Review data model and incorporate comments](phase4.md)
- [`Phase 5`: Finalise data model](phase5.md)
- [`Phase 6`: Create distributions and publish documentation](phase6.md)

For each step, the key activities of every stakeholder group are described. If you would like to know the more general roles and responsibilities of a stakeholder group, please have a look at the section defining roles and responsibilities. In a similar manner, key terms are defined in the glossary.
Next to the key activities, when relevant, additional information is provided in the form of rules and guidelines, tools or even examples. This is intended to make this methodology as actionable as it can be, giving the reader the means to develop OOTS data models for specific evidence types. 
Finally, for each step, three types of activities have been identified. 
1. Business analysis, i.e. identifying business needs and determining solutions.
2. Technical analysis, i.e. identifying technical requirements and determining solutions.  
3. Review, i.e. formal assessment potentially leading to changes.

Business analysis activities are more present in the beginning of the methodology and as moving forward through the methodology they make room for technical activities. Just like any project, business needs are defined before technical needs. Review activities are scattered through the methodology. 

GitHub is used as the platform for reviewing the data models as it is the de facto standard for developing technical specifications in a collaborative manner. Github offers built-in versioning control as well as other features that make it easy to propose suggestions and raise issues. ([Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) you can find the documentation on how to create issues on GitHub.) 

Engagement is a key element to the success of the different stages of the methodology. Having a high degree of participation from MS is therefore essential to achieve quality results which are consensus-driven. Working Group members, i.e. Member States representatives, should therefore be well represented during all activities.
