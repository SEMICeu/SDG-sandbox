Key aspects to consider:
•	Proprietary vs open access: 
o	Are there licences or other requirements for accessing the tool? 
•	Archiving and persistence: 
o	Who is owning and maintaining the tool? 
o	Has the owner engaged to store the content for a certain period? 
•	User-friendliness and adoption
o	What is the current level of adoption of the tool?
o	How easily can someone learn the basics?
•	Security
o	Is the content restricted?
•	Licensing
o	What are the licensing conditions?

GitHub
•	Proprietary vs open access: 
o	For contributing to a public repository, GitHub asks to create an account with a valid email address. 
o	Each account created can use 1 GB of storage and 1 GB of monthly bandwidth for free.
•	Archiving and persistence: 
o	GitHub, Inc. owned by Microsoft is the organisation owning GitHub.
o	GitHub intends to keep public repositories available except if specific conditions are met (such as violation of Terms of Service).
•	User-friendliness and adoption
o	Most of the Working Group members are familiar with GitHub.
o	Accessing and creating issues in GitHub is straightforward and well-documented. Additional features can be learnt along the way.
•	Security
o	There are no access restrictions for public repositories. 
•	Licensing
o	For public repositories, the administrator can decide which licence applies. GitHub provides guidelines for licensing public repositories. As the content of public repositories is publicly available, the licences proposed are open source.
