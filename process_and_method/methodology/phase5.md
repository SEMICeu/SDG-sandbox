## `Step 19` Identify and propose controlled vocabularies across the model 
**Key activities**
> * The [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) and the domain experts propose controlled vocabularies for the different attributes defined in the previous phases. 
> * The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) synthesize the propositions and complement with additional standard controlled vocabularies where relevant.  

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  Once a core set of common attributes has been agreed upon and that the [draft data model](../methodology/phase4.md#step-18--update-draft-data-model) is stable, the set of controlled vocabularies for those attributes need to analysed. The editors create a table with the common attributes along one dimension and the local implementation along the other dimension, placing the controlled vocabularies suggested in the cells. Along with the controlled vocabularies, the Working Group is tasked to propose usage notes for all the attributes agreed upon.

## `Step 20` Choose recommended controlled vocabularies
**Key activities**
> * The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) put forward the different propositions for each attribute working towards a decision
> * The [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) and domain experts discuss - through the collaborative tool - and select the controlled vocabularies to recommend 

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  Based on the table of controlled vocabularies, the Working Group discusses which controlled vocabularies are the most appropriate to be recommended as well as the soundness of the proposed usage notes. This may be based on the status of particular vocabularies (e.g. if they are based on an international standard) or on their usage across multiple implementations. 
  
  In the case of divergent views, a live discussion may be organised by the editors and moderators to agree on the most controversial proposed solutions

## `Step 21` Harmonise controlled vocabularies across the data model

**Key activities**
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) harmonise the controlled vocabularies and usage notes across the data model while ensureing the alignement between data models

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  The editors consider all controled vocabularies and usage notes across the data model, check their consistency and identify any overlaps or gaps. Editors may propose changes to the recommendations, for example if different controlled vocabularies have been recommended for identical or similar attributes. Editors may also propose slight changes to the usage notes, for example to harmonise the writing style across the model or solve inconsistencies.

## `Step 22` Document core set of attributes and recommended vocabularies

**Key activities**
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) document the consensus and construct the working draft. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  On the basis of discussions in `phase 4` and `phase 5`, the editors will document the decisions and prepare to update the draft data model.

## `Step 23` Finalise data model

**Key activities**
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) finalise the data model based on information collected in `step 19`, `step 20`, `step 21` and `step 22`. 
<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
    The draft data model expressed as an UML diagram with textual description (i.e. tables) of the entities, attributes, relationships, definitions, cardinalities, controlled vocabularies and usage notes is finalised. The editor constructs the final version of the data model based on the changes that have been agreed upon and derived from the previous four steps. Additionaly, the model is prepared for review.
