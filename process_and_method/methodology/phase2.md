## `Step 3` Identify and share existing models or examples of evidence

**Key activities**
> * The [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) members identify and share existing models or examples of evidence
> * The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) collect information from the Working Group members.

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  Working Group members will share information they possess related to the common data model being built.
  
  The objective is to gather information in order to have a global overview of data models implemented and used across Europe and leverage this insight to develop a common data model. This task is assigned to the Working Group members who will report back to the editors using the channels and collaborative tools defined.
  
  One important aspect of this step is **source of data quality**. This ensured by the requirement that all data comes from authoritative sources. Working Group members are responsible to identify and connect the authorities to the system.
  

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Rules and Guidelines</b></summary>
  
Before sending any data, the Working Group members should bear in mind the following;

  
* The data model has been validated and implemented by a competent authority;
* The data model has been issued in a final version; and
* The data model has been used in (cross-border) applications for exchange of information.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Tool(s)</b></summary>
  <i>The collaborative tool, e.g. Github.</i>

  <summary><b>Example(s)</b></summary>

Example of a data model shared by Spain, [issue #37](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/issues/37#issue-664501128)
</details>

## `Step 4` Analyse the models and derive necessary elements

**Key activities**
> * The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) analyse the existing models and check what is common and can be reused.

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  The editors analyse the models, concrete examples and other useful documentation that they received from the Working Group in the previous step.
  They specifically look for similarities (and dissimilarities) between the different models in order to identify a common set of entities, attributes and relationships,
  that are relevant for the respective evidence that is being analysed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Rules and Guidelines</b></summary>
  
  * The [SKOS Mapping Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping) can be used to compare entities or attributes across different models.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Tool(s)</b></summary>
  
* A spreadsheet tool can be used to present and compare the different data models.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Example(s)</b></summary>

TBD

</details>

## `Step 5` Select set of core entities, attributes and relationships

**Key activities**
> * The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) select the entities, attributes and relationships that are needed to model the respective evidence.

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  The editors analyse the output from the previous step and derive the entities, attributes and relationships that are common to most data models and that are necessary to model the evidence.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Rules and Guidelines</b></summary>
  * Be as specific as possible, without restricting local flexibility too much.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Tool(s)</b></summary>
  <i>There are no specific tools for this step.</i>
  
* A spreadsheet tool can be used to select the set of core entities, attribute and relationships of the common data model.
