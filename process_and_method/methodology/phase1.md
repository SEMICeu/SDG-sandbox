## `Step 1` Select the evidences  

**Key activities**
> The [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) members  and the [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) define together which evidences will be modelled. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
  The process consist of three sub-steps: 
  
* `Step 1.1` select procedures
* `Step 1.2` list of relevant evidences
* `Step 1.3` identify the comptetent authorities
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Rules and Guidelines</b></summary>
  
  According to Article 3 of the Regulation, evidence means _“any document or data, including text or sound, visual or audio-visual recording, irrespective of the medium used, required by a competent authority to  prove facts or compliance with procedural requirements referred to in point (b) of Article 2(2) of the regulation”._
  
* In a world of paper-based documents, evidence takes the form of a written document issued by a competent authority including some key information in a more or less structured way
* In a digital world made of databases and structured data exchange, the notion of evidence as a document is becoming obsolete. Digitally advanced Member States are exchanging and consuming pure data instead of documents to justify claims.

The notion of evidence as a document becomes obsolete. This approach is fundamentally changing the way these Member States store information and how they exchange information between public administrations.

Currently, both approaches coexist across Member States and are taken into account when developing data models. 

In the evidence-based approach, it is not always clear for civil servants in a public administration front office why a type of evidence is requested to perform a given procedure – i.e. which criteria the evidence proves that the user fulfils. In this sense, users are required to provide a set of evidences and the procedure is centred on provision of those evidences. In a criteria-based approach, the procedure moves away from evidence as such, and focuses on specific data about the user that proves the user fulfils a set of criteria to be met. In essence, the two approaches seek to answer the same question, but the question is framed differently.

## `Step 1.1` Select procedures 

**Key activities**
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) analyse which procedures should be selected. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>

The listing of available procedures will help to determine the scope of future exchange flows between competent authorities requesting and issuing evidence within the SDG OOP technical system. The Editors have to define whether a procedure exists in all countries for the latter to be considered in the next step.

The non-availability of a procedure in a country may be due to various reason and automatically disqualify the procedure for the next step. 

Additionaly, the complexity of procedure can be assessed. Three categories are identified; 

* A low level of complexity is assigned to procedures, which correspond to one specific procedure conducted in a relatively similar way across Member States
* A medium level of complexity is assigned to procedures, which correspond to two separate procedures, or to one procedure which may involve separate options
* A high level of complexity is assigned to procedures which correspond to more than two procedures, and which typically involve different competent authorities

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Rules and Guidelines</b></summary>
  
  * The procedure is available in all Member States; 
  * The management of the procedure is regulated by a competent authority; 
  * The procedure involve the use of at least one evidence.

  The procedures in scope of the SDG OOP technical system are those listed under Annex II of the SDGR and Directives 2005/36/EC, 2006/123/EC, 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU

## `Step 1.2` List of relevant evidences 

**Key activities**
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) analyse which evidences should be selected. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>

In order to understand what would be the actual types of evidence exchanged as part of the SDG OOP technical system. For each procedure, the list of evidences likley to be exchanged should be identified. The relevance of cross-border evidence should be assessed as follow, i.e. whether the evidence required to complete the procedure is likely to be fetched from abroad. 

* **Low**: there is no or little cross-border exchange of evidence (incl. case where no evidence is requested)
* **Medium**: there is a limited case for the exchange of evidence across-borders (only a few Member States request evidence that could be fetched across borders)
* **High**: there is a clear case for the exchange of evidence across-borders

## `Step 1.3` Identify the competent authorities 

**Key activities**
> The [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) members identify and map competent authorities with the selected evidences.
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) provide a means to collect the input from the [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) members

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>

In order to further refine the scope of evidence that will be exchanged under the SDG OOP technical system, and by extension will be modelled, it remains to be seen which types of evidence are lawfully issued by a competent authority.

The competent authorities are most often public bodies at the national, regional and local levels – such as Ministries, National Social Security and Pensions systems, Regulatory Authorities, Local authorities and others. In some rare cases, the competent authority may be a private body or institution acting with a mandate from public authorities. For the latter, it is important to assess whether certain identified bodies can indeed be considered a competent authority (e.g. private universities, private health insurance companies).

Needless to say that an evidence not lawfully issued by a competent authority (e.g. evidence produced by the private sector/individuals such as invoice, leasing contract, sworn declaration) will be automatically considered out of scope.

## `Step 2` Evidences likely to be exchanged

**Key activities**
> The [<b>editors</b>](../stakeholders#editors) propose which evidences should be modelled. 
> The [<b>Working Group</b>](../stakeholders#working-group) members validate which evidences should be modelled. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Description</b></summary>
  
In line with the article 14 of the SDG regulation, only the types of evidence that meet the following conditions will be exchanged under the SDG OOP technical system:

1. The procedure requires evidence beyond identification;
2. There are cases in which the evidence can be located abroad;
3. The evidence is lawfully issued by a competent authority (under SDGR); and 
4. The evidence is available in an electronic format that allows for automated exchange.

First, when a procedure does not request any type of evidence other than identification, the procedure is not in scope of the technical system. Second, some types of evidence requested – other than identification – cannot originate from abroad due to their nature (e.g.  proof of compliance of facilities with local sanitary or security legislation). Third, the evidence needs to be lawfully issued by a competent authority. Finally, following Article 14(2) of the Regulation, only evidence lawfully issued “in an electronic format that allows automated exchange” needs to be made available by Member States. Therefore, a type of evidence not issued in such a format by a given Member State will not be in scope of the technical system.
