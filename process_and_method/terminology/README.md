## Glossary

### Application profile

A data model defining which entities and attributes to use, what the cardinalities of the attributes are and recommendations for core vocabularies  to be used, in order to support a particular application or use case(s).

### Attribute

A characteristic of an entity in a particular dimension such as the weight of an object, the name of an organisation or the date and time that an observation was made, often representing things or events in the real world.

### Data model

A data model is an abstract model that organises elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another. It specifies the entities, their attributes and the relationships between entities. 

### Entity

A 'thing', such as a vessel, a geographic location, a sensor, a map or something more abstract like an incident, an event or an observation.

### Relationship

A link between two concepts; examples are the link between an observation and the sensor that produced it, the link between a document and the organisation that published it, or the link between a map and the geographic region it depicts.

### Semantic agreement

Consensus among the working group on the model and data entities that support common services. Apart from the typology of the data entities, the consensus also covers the characteristics of the data entities as expressed in metadata and the use of common controlled vocabularies.
