# Terminologies

This pages contains the definitions (and illustrations) of the different concepts and terms used throughout the repository. 

## Glossary

### Application profile

A data model defining which entities and attributes to use, what the cardinalities of the attributes are and recommendations for core vocabularies to be used, in order to support a particular application or use case(s).

### Attribute

A characteristic of an entity in a particular dimension such as the weight of an object, the name of an organisation or the date and time that an observation was made, often representing things or events in the real world.

### Controlled vocabulary
A controlled vocabulary is an authoritative list of terms to be used in indexing. Controlled vocabularies do not necessarily have any structure or relationship between terms within the list.


### Data model

A data model is an abstract model that organises elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another. It specifies the entities, their attributes and the relationships between entities.

### Entity

A 'thing', such as a vessel, a geographic location, a sensor, a map or something more abstract like an incident, an event or an observation.

### Procedure
Set of administrative formalities or steps to be followed in order to carry out a request.

*Example*

| Life events |                 Procedures                | Expected output subject to an assessment of the application by the competent authority in accordance with national law, where relevant |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Birth       | Requesting proof of registration of birth | Proof of registration of birth or birth certificate                                                                                    |
| Residence   | Requesting proof of residence             | Confirmation of registration at the current address                                                                                    |


### Relationship

A link between two concepts; examples are the link between an observation and the sensor that produced it, the link between a document and the organisation that published it, or the link between a map and the geographic region it depicts.

### Semantic agreement

Consensus among the working group on the data model and data entities that support common services. Apart from the typology of the data entities, the consensus also covers the characteristics of the data entities as expressed in metadata and the use of common controlled vocabularies.

### Vocabulary 

In the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as “terms”) used to describe and represent an area of concern.
