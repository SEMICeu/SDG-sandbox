# Quality

The quality aspect is addressed at three different levels: 

## data models
This is ensured by using the **proposed methodology**, which is based on the existing SEMIC methodology. In addition, we build as much as possible on **existing resources**, like the ISAÂ² Core Vocabularies, the Public/eJustice documents, EUCARIS, EU Vocabularies of the Publications Office etc., taking into account the **feedback and suggestions of the member states**, building consensus and delivering detailed documentation.


## instance data 
[the actual evidences to be exchanged] in terms of **correctness of the XML data** with respect to the data models: this can be supported by tools like **the Interoperability testbed** and can be included as a post-development step after phase 7 (finalisation) of the methodology.

## source of data
This is ensured by the requirement that all data comes from **authoritative sources**. Member States are responsible for identifying and connecting the relevant authorities to the system.
