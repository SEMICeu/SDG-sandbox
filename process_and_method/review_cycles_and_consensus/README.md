# Review cycles and consensus

The process through which semantic agreements can be reached among working group members in a consensus-building activity. 

## Consensus 

Consensus is a generally accepted opinion or general agreement among a group of people.

<blockquote><i>
Consensus is the heart of the process to develop common data models. It aims at developing a collective output, which is the reflection of the greatest possible number of views. 

Indeed, consensus involves looking for solutions that are acceptable to all. When everyone agrees with a decision, they are more likely to implement it and, in our case, ultimately use the common data models being built. Consensus is built through iterations, called review cycles.

In the process defined, consensus takes the form of proposals shared, valued and debated to work towards [semantic agreement](../terminology#semantic-agreement). Semantic agreements aim to meet everyone's most important needs and find a balance between what different Working Group members want, while bearing in mind data minimization and data sensitivity. 

Transparency and record keeping are important aspects of achieving consensus. Therefore, all proposals must be debated and documented. 

Once a proposal has been dealt with, stakeholders are informed of the groupâ€™s decision and reasoning. However, there may be times when consensus cannot be reached on an issue or on a comment received. In such cases, one possible course of action is to seek external guidance.</i></blockquote> 

## Review cycle
Review cycle is when a (working) draft model is shared with the Working Group so that the members can provide comments and proposals for change. It is during this activity that the consensus is built. 

<blockquote><i>All stakeholders should bear in mind to always ensure that the broadest possible consensus is achieved when a review cycle is carried out. Once reviewed, proposals are categorized and addressed, leading to a new version of the (working) draft model.</i></blockquote>
