# Stakeholders

This page describes the stakeholders identified in the process of developing data models along with their role and responsibilities. 

## Roles and responsibilities

The shared goal of [developing a set of common data models [...] that best serves the interests of the SDG regulation and the Member States (MS)](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox#data-semantics-formats--quality) is broken down in [different phases](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/process_and_method/methodology). These different phases are executed by distinct groups, which are described below.

### Authority
Final decision owner regarding the results of development of the data models. 
<blockquote>
<i>In the context of this Work Package, the European Commission is taking this role.</i>
</blockquote>

### Working Group
The Working Group members contribute to the different deliverables and help others to meet the deadline of the SDG. Ideally, knowledge of the SDG is required and semantic awareness is recommended. 
<blockquote>
<i>In the context of this Work Package, the Working Group is composed of representatives of Member States. 
Representatives attend the webinars and coordinate the work at the national level.</i>
</blockquote>

#### Domain experts
They can be divided per domain or [evidence type](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox#types-of-evidence) (e.g. vital records, vehicles, etc.). They are the people who have the business experience from the domain. They know how the evidence is used, for which procedures, by whom and, most importantly, the information described within each type of evidence. 
<blockquote>
<i>In the context of the SDG, one expert per domain should ideally be reachable for each country. 
Alternatively, a pool of 2-5 experts per domain would be enough to provide the expected input with the Working Group making sure that all the Member States have the possibility to monitor the quality of the work and the models proposed.</i>
</blockquote>

### Editor(s)
Leads the drafting of the deliverables and data models by integrating and consolidating the input received from the Working Group.

### Moderator
Works with the Rapporteur to ensure that the objectives, deliverables and deadlines of the Work Package are well defined and followed-up. Communicates with other Work Packages to ensure alignement.

### Rapporteur 
Collects input from the Working Group, ensures that the Working Group is aligned to the deadline of each deliverable in collaboration with the Moderator. Communicates with other Work Packages to ensure alignement. The Rapporteur is drawn from the Working Group.
