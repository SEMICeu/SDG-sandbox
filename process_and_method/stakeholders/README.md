## Roles and responsibilities

This section describes the stakeholders identified in the process of developing data models along with their roles and responsibilities.

The shared goal of [developing a set of common data models [...] that best serves the interests of the SDG regulation and the Member States (MS)](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox#data-semantics-formats--quality) is broken down in [different phases](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/process_and_method/methodology). These different phases are executed by distinct groups, which are described below.

### Authority
Final decision owner regarding the results of development of the data models in cases where no consensus could be reached. 
<blockquote><i>In the context of the SDG Work Package 4, the European Commission is taking this role.</i></blockquote>

### Working Group members
The Working Group members contribute to the different deliverables and help others to meet the incremental goals and deadlines mutually agreed upon upfront. Working Group members will be responsible for achieving consensus. 

Ideally, knowledge of the SDG is required and semantic awareness is recommended.

In addition to the core activities - defining data models - it is important for the Working Group to know how the output of this methodology will fit the technical aspect of the SDG OOP. For example, "how are the data models going to be used in the exchange of information?". This requires IT knowledge which could be included under the responsibility of the Editors or by including an IT representative of the SDG OOP in all relevant activities of the methodology.

<blockquote><i>In the context of the SDG Work Package 4, the Working Group is composed of representatives of Member States. Representatives attend the webinars and coordinate the work at the national level. It was recommended to have not only people with “semantic awareness” but also data modellers and data stewards.</i></blockquote>

#### Domain experts
The domain experts can be divided per domain or [evidence type](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox#types-of-evidence) (e.g. vital records, vehicles, etc.). They are the people who have the business experience from the domain. They know how the evidence is used, for which procedures, by whom and, most importantly, the information described within each type of evidence.
Domain experts should be reachable and available throughout the development of the data model.  

<blockquote>
<i>In the context of the SDG Work Package 4, one expert per domain should ideally be reachable by the representatives of Member States composing the Working Group. Alternatively, a pool of 2-5 experts per domain would be enough to provide the expected input with the Working Group making sure that all the Member States have the possibility to monitor the quality of the work and the models proposed.</i>
</blockquote>

### Editors

The Editors lead the drafting of the deliverables and specification (i.e. data model) by integrating and consolidating the input received from the Working Group. Specifically, the role of the Editors is threefold:

* To create a formal specification which is in line with the best practices in regards to data modeling and data standards reuse.
* To motivate and explain how every information request being discussed is either adopted in the formal specification, or not.  
* To initiate the consensus making process around discussion topics.

<blockquote><i>In the context of SDG Work Package 4, the editors are external to the European Commission and the Working Group. They are responsible for doing the groundwork, collecting and aggregating the input.</i></blockquote>

### Moderator
The moderator works with the rapporteur to ensure that the objectives, deliverables and deadlines of the Work Package are well defined and followed-up. The moderator communicates with other Work Packages to ensure alignment.

<blockquote><i>In the context of SDG Work Package 4, the moderator is an official of the Commission, who is in contact with other work packages as well as the directing bodies.</i></blockquote>

### Rapporteur 
The rapporteur collects input from the Working Group, ensures that the Working Group is on time in respect of the deadline of each deliverable in collaboration with the moderator. Also, both the moderator and rapporteur communicate with other Work Packages to ensure alignment. The rapporteur is drawn from the Working Group.

<blockquote><i>In the context of SDG Work Package 4, the rapporteur is a member of the Working Group. At the outset, Working Members were given the possibility to take up the role of rapporteur.</i></blockquote>
