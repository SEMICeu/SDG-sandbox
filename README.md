# SDG-sandbox
Welcome to the GitHub repository of Work Package 4 - Data Semantics, Formats & Quality. This space allows domain experts across EU member states to review data models to be used in the context of cross-border exchange of evidences. 

## SDG OOP
The OOP Technical System is an eco-system involving a wide variety of systems distributed across and operated by the EU Member States, supported by the EC. To function effectively, and to allow Member States to integrate their existing systems, the system needs detailed semantics & formats agreement for these systems to interact and exchange data (evidences) in the context of the OOP system.

## Data Semantics, Formats & Quality
Work Package 4 - Data Semantics, Formats and Quality (WP4) will build on the initial work carried out as part of the 2017.05 Interoperability requirements for the Single Digital Gateway action. This action provided the technical basis for the implementation of the future Regulation by detailing the IT architecture of the Single Digital Gateway and by identifying functional, technical and semantic interoperability challenges for the development of the IT tools and their interconnection with EU Member States IT tools and EU level tools[[1]](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/actions/common-architecture-single-digital-gateway_en).

WP4, which must assure continuity towards the implementation of the SDG regulation has a twofold objective :

* The WP will develop a set of common data models following an incremental or phased approach that best serves the interests of the SDG regulation and the Member States (MS); and
* Relying on the first objective – and in parallel – the WP will develop and test a methodology for defining further common data models, formats and quality for the exchange of evidence between the Member States.

The work done [[2]](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2015-03/Process%20and%20methodology%20for%20developing%20semantic%20agreements.pdf) in the past years under the ISA² programme and its action SEMIC will serve as a solid base to build a methodology, based on best practices and testing this methodology to certain types of evidence with a working group composed of Member States representatives. Furthermore, the methodology will be refined in the development of the data models as part of the first objective of this WP. 

The high-level steps of the WP on the short-term are as follows:

* Analysis on evidence types, criteria, prerequisites through an iterative approach based on feedback by MS;
* Definition of common data formats for a first round of evidence;
* Apply and refine the methodology

Concerning the medium-term, the steps are:

* Definition of common data formats for a second round of evidence;
* Agreement on action points before starting the next phase and outputs to be handled into the next phase;
* Delivery of the methodology to define data models

### Access to the SDG OOP collaborative space
To have access to the SDG Once-Only collaborative space, you need to be a member of one of the groups that has permission to view/edit this space. The Single Digital Gateway Coordination Group members have been already subject to a formal nomination procedure and are responsible for indicating any changes to the access rights of their own experts: addition, remove etc. Please contact your SDG country representative if you wish to be granted access. 

## Types of evidence

### First round

* [Birth evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/birth_certificate/data_model)
* [Marriage evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/marriage_certificate/data_model)
* [Vehicle registration evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/vehicle_registration_certificate/data_model) 
* [Income tax declaration evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/income_tax_declaration_certificate/data_model)
* [Evidence of completion of secondary education](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/certificate_of_completion_of_secondary_education/data_model)

For the second round,  the WP4 will be tasked to develop common data models for the following evidences; 

* [Tertiary education diploma evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/tertiary_education_diploma_evidence/data_model)
* [Tertiary education diploma supplement evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/tertiary_education_supplement_evidence/data_model)
* [Record  of results evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/record_of_results_evidence/data_model) 
* [Absence of a criminal record evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/absence_of_a_criminal_record_evidence/data_model)

### Second round

* [Absence of a criminal record](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/absence_of_a_criminal_record_evidence/data_model)
* [Tertiary education diploma evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/tertiary_education_diploma_evidence/data_model)
* [Tertiary education diploma supplement evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/tertiary_education_diploma_supplement_evidence/data_model) 
* [Record of results evidence](https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/tree/master/evidences/record_of_results_evidence/data_model)

## Issue log
Issues in this repository should address substantive and semantic issues related to the different common data models. 

When logging an issue;

* Mention the evidence to which the issue applies;
* Describe the entity(ies) and / or attribute(s) to which the issue applies; 
* Describe the problem;
* Describe the possible solution; and
* Use labels to the extent possible. 

The editorial team aims to respond to the issue within one working day and the issue will be on the agenda for the next webinar.
